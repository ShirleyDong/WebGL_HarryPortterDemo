In this assignment, I use three.js library to build a webVR experience, here are the steps of building the project.1.Download the 3D models from website, unzip it.2.Create camera, light, scene, render and clock variable. 3.Create a HTML webpage, load 3D models into the  scene use ColladaLoader and create model variables which receive shadow of the light.4.Create mesh variables and add image texture and mapping variables to the mesh.5.Add fragment and vertex script to the html, create a sphere and add reflection (environment mapping). Create two plane, add moving texture. Add movie texture to the billboard object.7. Add spatial sound to the scene by using Omnitone API.8.Build a GUI to change the colour, intensity, angle and display of the directional light by use the js library.9.Animate light and camera.Problem (unsolved):1. Change the range of the directional light shadow.2. Customize the animation of the camera(create a moving path).Reference:https://threejs.org/https://stemkoski.github.io/Normal mapping:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdnN5nuxj-s
